# The Task to be performed :

   1.Join Logic: Take the Parking Meter data and join it with a secondary "Rate" table (you can provide a dummy Rate CSV).

   2.SCD Type 2: Parking rates change. Implement a logic that tracks when a meter's "Hourly Rate" changed, keeping the old rate in history with start_date and end_date.

   3.Geospatial : Extract the Latitude and Longitude and find all meters located within a specific "Ward" or "Neighborhood."

   4.Scaling: If this data was being streamed via Apache Kafka, describe the "Producer" and "Consumer" architecture you would use.
